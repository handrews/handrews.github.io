identification mechanisms for the Web.  They propose new URN (sub-)namespaces or
URI schemes and provide
registries for instances thereof, in order to allow them to be used to identify
and retrieve information resources.  This
would appear to be incompatible with <a href="#AWWW">[AWWW]</a>'s simple positive
recommendations.  In this finding we enumerate the arguments given in favor of
these new proposals, which often turn out to be arguments <em>against</em>
using <code>http:</code> URIs, and explain why they are mistaken and how the above
principles can be understood to point the way constructively to alternative
designs which do in fact make use of <code>http:</code> URIs.</p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="args_nri" id="args_nri"></a>2 Examining the need for new approaches to naming information resources</h2><p>This section is structured in terms of goals or requirements for resource
identification mechanisms which have been offered as justifications for
adopting a new approach.  They are drawn from a number of recent proposals
(<a href="#NZL">[NZL]</a>, <a href="#RFC3688">[RFC 3688]</a>, <a href="#UBL">[UBL]</a>, <a href="#XRI">[XRI]</a>, <a href="#INFO">[RFC 4452]</a>)
abstracting, merging and summarizing them.   Although we will examine some of
these proposals in specific detail in the three cases studies below, in this
section [<a name="nri" id="nri" title="myRI">Definition</a>: we will use the name <b>myRI</b> as a
cover term for this general class of proposed alternatives to
<code>http:</code>, both those proposing new URI schemes and those proposing
new URN sub-schemes.]  In each case we state a requirement and examine the extent to which the existing <code>http:</code>-based identifier mechanism addresses it.</p><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="persist_con" id="persist_con"></a>2.1 Persistence</h3><p class="prefix">NRI Goal</p><p class="nri_des">The relation between <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> and the information resource
they identify should <em>persist indefinitely</em>.</p><p>Or, more realistically, that individual <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> should
manifest syntactically whether or not they are <em>intended</em> to persist indefinitely.</p><p>This goal is difficult to get to grips with, as it appears to mean
different things in different contexts:</p><ol class="enumar"><li><p>At its simplest, this is just a wish for an end to <code>404 Not
Found</code>, i.e. that you should always be able to resolve a <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a>.</p></li><li><p>In the Information Science community, 'persistence' is a stronger
requirement, namely, that <em>what</em> you get when you resolve a <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> should never change.</p></li></ol><p class="prefix">http: fact</p><p class="http_fact"><code>http:</code> URIs support persistence as well as
it is in-practice possible to do so.</p><p>As has been frequently observed, achieving either of the numbered types of
persistence above is not a
technology issue, it's a management issue.  It's up to the owners and operators
of the mechanisms which implement <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> resolution to enforce whatever degree
of persistence they choose.  It follows that there is no difference here
between <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> and <code>http:</code>.</p><p>What of the more sophisticated reading, that a <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> should manifest its
minter's <em>intentions</em> with respect to persistence?  That's just a
matter of naming conventions, and perfectly possible using <code>http:</code>.  We could, for example, say that all
versionable/time-varying resources on our site are named with all lower-case
letters, and all persistent/stable/non-varying resources are named with all
upper-case letters.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="standard_con" id="standard_con"></a>2.2 Standardized</h3><p class="prefix">NRI Goal</p><p class="nri_des"><a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> should be susceptible to
standardization within administrative units</p><p>This goal appears to be directed at guaranteeing certain invariants, for
example with respect to the structure of identifiers and the availability of
the resources they identify.  This means they should not be 
creatable in a distributed or unsupervised fashion.</p><p class="prefix">http: fact</p><p class="http_fact">Again, this is largely a management issue, not a
technical one.  Whatever invariants are in view can as well be enforced on
(sub-parts of) <code>http:</code>-served resource collections as on those
identified via <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a>.</p><p>Nothing in a specification can stop
people from uttering URIs of any kind.  Domain names are as good, or as bad, at
conveying ownership of a particular form of URI as URN namespaces or URI schemes.</p><p>Centralized authorities can be established for parts of domain space as
easily as for areas "off the web", and enforcement mechanisms can be as
effective.  For example, my employers constrain the mechanisms by
which web pages are accepted for serving from certain parts of their domain so as to enforce invariants both of
path structure <em>and</em> content markup.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="protocol_independent" id="protocol_independent"></a>2.3 Protocol Independence</h3><p class="prefix">NRI Goal</p><p class="nri_des">Access to resources identified by <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a>
should not be <em>dependent</em> on any particular protocol.</p><p>Exactly what this means is not clear -- although it is listed as a
requirement in several cases, there is little or no discussion, so exactly why it should be a requirement for <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> is not clear.</p><p class="prefix">http: fact</p><p class="http_fact"><code>http:</code> URIs are no more protocol-dependent
than any other identification mechanism.</p><p>For pure naming, that is, if retrieval is never intended,
<code>http:</code> is as good as any <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> approach, because no protocol at
all is involved.  If retrieval <em>is</em> anticipated, then any <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a>
approach must specify a mapping to one or more
protocols.  All existing <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> approaches in practice specify only one such
mapping, to the <code>HTTP</code> protocol.  So they are in exactly the
<em>same</em> position as <code>http:</code> -- if for some reason in the
future the <code>HTTP</code> protocol becomes unavailable or inappropriate,
both <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> and <code>http:</code> will have to specify a new mapping.</p><p>True protocol independence is difficult to imagine in practice, as many
protocols depend on a tight coupling between message formats and client/server
application models.  Protocols which don't allow servers any escape mechanism
are thereby pretty much ruled out as transports for retrieval from <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> (or
<code>http:</code> URIs).</p><p>It's appropriate to note here that in cases where
the necessary form of client/server interaction for a particular kind of
information resource, for example streaming video, cannot be provided by the
protocols normally associated with existing URI schemes, new schemes may be
appropriate.  Detailed discussion of this point can be found in <a href="#schemeProtocols">[Schemes and Protocols]</a>.  But none of the <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> proposals are for resources of this kind.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="loc_independent" id="loc_independent"></a>2.4 Location Independence</h3><p class="prefix">NRI Goal</p><p class="nri_des"><a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a>
should not be <em>locations</em>.</p><p>Practical realities and administrative changes will always defeat any
attempt to guarantee that the representation of a particular resource will
always be stored in exactly the same host/server/filestore/directory/file.  Any
naming mechanism which equates locations in that sense with names is by
construction inadequate.  It follows that this goal is a sensible one.</p><p class="prefix">http: fact</p><p class="http_fact"><code>http:</code> URIs are <em>not</em> locations.</p><p>Misunderstanding of <code>http:</code> URIs as locations has a long and,
in part, justifiable history (they were, after all, originally called Uniform
Resource Locators).  But it's not longer justifiable either in principle (the
RFC for URIs <a href="#URI">[RFC 3986]</a> is quite clear on
the subject) or in practice (there's lots of software support for server-side
management of the
relationship between <code>http:</code> URIs and their representations).  See
for example the classic <a href="#coolURIs">[Cool URIs]</a> for a more detailed discussion
of these points.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="taggable" id="taggable"></a>2.5 Structured names</h3><p class="prefix">NRI Goal</p><p class="nri_des"><a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> should provide for structuring resource identifiers
with shareable tags</p><p>This requirement has only been suggested by the authors of <a href="#XRI">[XRI]</a>.  It amounts to a wish to structure resource names using name/value pairs, with the names having some standardized, widely understood meaning.  This requirement is related to requirements appealed to in the design of End Point References <a href="#EPR">[EPRs]</a>, <a href="#TAGEPR">[TAG on EPRs]</a>.</p><p class="prefix">http: fact</p><p class="http_fact">The query component of <code>http:</code> URIs supports
non-hierarchical structured naming.</p><p>It is open to any naming authority to establish
conventions for the use of the query component of <code>http:</code> URIs under
its control.  Since the query component is already structured in terms of
simple name/value pairs, it is a good fit for the requirement.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="metadata" id="metadata"></a>2.6 Uniform access to metadata</h3><p class="prefix">NRI Goal</p><p class="nri_des"><a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> should provide as well for access to metadata about
as to representations of a resource.</p><p>Several <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> proposals establish a constructive relation between the <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a>
for a resource and the <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> for metadata <em>about</em> that resource.</p><p class="prefix">http: fact</p><p class="http_fact">Naming conventions or response headers can provide this already</p><p>Naming authorities can impose such constraints on the <code>http:</code> URIs
under their control.  Alternatively, and particularly where it is appropriate
to allow for meta-metadata, etc., the <code>Link:</code> response header
<a href="#RFC2068">[RFC 2068]</a> may
provide equivalent functionality in a more extensible way.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="authority" id="authority"></a>2.7 Flexible Authority</h3><p class="prefix">NRI Goal</p><p class="nri_des"><a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> require different approaches to identifying namespace authorities,

the equivalent <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> (compare e.g. <!--<a href="http://lccn.info/2002022641">--><code>http://lccn.info/2002022641<!--</a>--></code> to
<code>info:lccn/2002022641</code>), while gaining all <code>http:</code>'s benefits of
scalability and installed base.</p><table border="1" summary="Editorial note: HST"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="50%"><b>Editorial note: HST</b></td><td align="right" valign="top" width="50%">2006-06-06</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">HST now owns <code>lccn.info</code> and <code>oclcnum.info</code>, will sell to Stuart Weibel

<h2><a name="args_http" id="args_http"></a>3 The value of  <code>http:</code> URIs</h2><p>The <code>http:</code> URI scheme implements a two-part approach to
identifying resources.  It combines a universal distributed naming scheme for
owners of resources with a hierarchical syntax for distinguishing
resources which share the same owner.  Widely available mechanisms (DNS and web
servers, respectively) exist to support the use of <code>http:</code> URIs to
not only identify but actually retrieve representations of information resources.</p><p>Any requirement for naming resources, particularly if not only naming but
also retrieval of representations is in prospect, which admits to a similar
decomposition, that is, into a universal owner name and a hierarchical
owner-relative name, can almost certainly be satisfied by the
<code>http:</code> URI scheme.  <code>http:</code> provides substantial benefits, in terms of installed
software base, user comprehension, scalability and, if required, security, at
very low cost.</p><p>Anyone developing an alternative approach, that is, some form of <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a>,
should consider carefully whether that approach is either isomorphic to
<code>http:</code>, or makes covert appeal to <code>http:</code> for its
implementation.  In either case, this strongly suggests that the fundamental
requirements of the new approach do in fact admit to the two-part description
given above, and therefore that <code>http:</code> itself would be a viable,
and therefore a preferred, way forward.</p><p>The example in section <a href="#authority"><b>2.7 Flexible Authority</b></a> above is illustrative of
the benefits that the ubiquitity of the installed base of support for
<code>http:</code> provide -- within 15 minutes of registering the <code>lccn.info</code>
domain, the <!--<a href="http://lccn.info">--><code>http://lccn.info/<!--</a>--></code> homepage had
been put in place and was available to anyone with a web browser and
access to the Web.</p></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="iddiv1128776056" id="iddiv1128776056"></a>4 Case study: Naming namespaces</h2><p>In this section we look in detail into some of the background
assumptions for the utility of <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> for one particular purpose, namely for
naming namespaces.  We will compare the use of <code>http:</code> and of <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a>
for this purpose.</p><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="iddiv2128777624" id="iddiv2128777624"></a>4.1 Context</h3><p>The XML Namespaces specification <a href="#XMLNS">[XML Namespaces]</a> is the
context-defining specification for namespace names.   It specifies that
namespace names are for use in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#dt-expname">expanded names</a> consisting
of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#dt-NSName">namespace name</a> (or no value) plus a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#dt-localname">local name</a>.  An <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#dt-expname">expanded name</a> may be compared against other <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#dt-expname">expanded names</a>.  Very common scenarios are for performing well-formedness checking and for content model validation.  The namespace specification, roughly speaking, says that a
namespace name cannot be assumed to be dereferenceable.  Any software
component that is written assuming that any namespace name <em>must</em> be
dereferencable is violating the namespace specification.  It may be that
the namespace owner has guaranteed that they will provide a document at
the namespace name, but namespace owners are not required to do so and not all do.  As a result of this, generic XML software should not be written to
assume dereferencability of namespace names.</p><p>Any use of identifiers, from namespace names to isbn numbers to invoices, requires a context.  The context will define the use of the identifier
and includes social and technical context.  A URI on the side of a bus
will probably convey the social meaning that it can be typed into a browser.  Other contexts for the use of URIs include namespace names,
references to documents, and identifiers for <em>things</em>.  It is never
the case that a URI is simply "found" without a context.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="iddiv2141223296" id="iddiv2141223296"></a>4.2 Identification</h3><p>First we examine the use of an <code>http:</code> URI for a namespace name.

For example, the first namespace name for the first major release of the Invoice document has the form <code>urn:oasis:names:tc:ubl:schema:xsd:Invoice-1.0</code>, such as:

<h3><a name="iddiv2137840152" id="iddiv2137840152"></a>4.3 Persistence of Identifiers</h3><p>Let us know examine the persistence of the identifiers.  The
<code>oasis</code> URN namespace, as used in <code>urn:oasis:names:tc:ubl:schema:xsd:Invoice-1.0</code>, is assigned by the OASIS organization and registered with IANA.   OASIS has the authority to change its identifying scheme, subject to IANA review.  Additionally, the actual names are decided by OASIS.  As with all URNs, the persistence of any particular identifier and scheme are up to the registering organization.</p><p>An <code>http:</code> URI for OASIS namespace names, such as
<code>http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-rx/wsrm/200602</code>, is assigned by the
OASIS organization because it owns the <code>oasis-open.org</code> domain.  They do not have to register the complete URI anywhere.  OASIS has the authority to change the template on it's own, without any review.  Additionally, the actual URIs are decided by OASIS.  As with all URIs, the persistence of any particular identifier and schema are up to the owner of the domain.   It is possible for the domain to cease being owned by OASIS, through lack of maintenance or even error. </p><p>We might imagine a scenario many years down the road where OASIS no longer
exists.  It would not maintain the <code>oasis-open.org</code> domain name and
<code>http:</code> identifiers using that domain would no longer be assigned.  Alternatively, OASIS does not produce or mint any new URNs.  In either case, the identifiers are not dereferenced so all the existing software works.</p><p>In URN and <code>http:</code> scheme cases, the persistence of the identifier is accomplished by the organization.  The ongoing existence of the organization does not affect the persistence of the identifiers.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="iddiv2137842352" id="iddiv2137842352"></a>4.4 Dereferencability</h3><p>But, if one of these identifiers appears in a document, how will a human
find out the meaning?  One approach is examine the context
surrounding the identifier, in this case the XML document and the Namespaces specification.  They will look in the XML Namespace specification and see what it says about namespaces.  There is no benefit to the <code>xri:</code>
versus <code>http:</code> as the work in examining the XML document and XML
namespace specifications are the same.  Alternatively, they may try to dereference the
namespace name, but it's not deferenceable so they get no information.</p><p>It is natural for a human reading an XML document with an unknown namespace name to want to understand more about the namespace.
This is why <a href="#AWWW">[AWWW]</a> recommends providing a document at a namespace name
that provides both human and machine readable information.  The use of
<code>http:</code> namespace names enables 3 separate scenarios:
    <ol class="enumar"><li><p>an identifier
can be created in a decentralized manner;</p></li><li><p>an identifier may
be dereferenced by a person via a browser to aid understanding;</p></li><li><p>an
identifier may be dereferenced by a computer and exploited for automatic
processing by reason of its identifying schemas, WSDLs, policies, etc.</p></li></ol></p><p>These are two distinct interaction patterns, without and with human
involvement. </p><p>In all dereferencable identifier scenarios, an identifier must be usable to generate an authority.  There may be interactions with multiple authorities to determine the "final" authority for the identifier.  The final authority uses the identifier to produce a document.</p><p>In the <code>http:</code> identifiers, the authority is specified immediately after the scheme.  The authority system in <code>http:</code> URIs is the internet's DNS and IP systems.  One or more DNS authorities produces an IP destination as the final authority.  That authority is then sent the remaining part of the URI for dereferencing.   In the case of <code>http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-rx/wsrm/200602</code>, the HTTP interaction is </p><div class="exampleOuter">

<h3><a name="iddiv2137969152" id="iddiv2137969152"></a>4.5 Erroneous appearance of dereferencability of identifiers</h3><p>A common reason given for needing <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> for namespace
names is that an <code>http:</code> identifier appears to humans as a location and
hence dereferencable.  	The argument that <code>http:</code> URIs are "locations" is based upon
incomplete understanding of the use of URIs.  A classic scenario is that a
human looks at an XML document using a word-processing application, and the
application formats the value of an <code>xmlns</code> attribute as a
hyperlink, because it is an <code>http:</code> URI, say <a href="http://example.org/ns/foo">http://example.org/ns/foo</a>.  But as there is no document dereferencable from that URI, when the user clicks on the link an HTTP 404 will be returned.  The obvious downside is that the user has wasted some time, typically around 5-10 seconds.  There is no additional harm than that in clicking and getting a 404.</p><p>Under what circumstances are identifiers viewed as "clickable", that is what are the contexts?   In this document, neither of the <code>xmlns</code> links have shown up as clickable.  When these documents were pasted into an email, they were not converted to clickable.  The <code>http:</code> link was converted to clickable only when the <code>myns</code> attribute was typed by hand and auto-complete was on.  It was the e-mail program's "auto-complete" that saw an <code>http:</code> within a pair of quotes and made it clickable.   It also required that rich text or HTML formatting is selected in creator and receiver/viewer.  When viewed in plain text, the link is not clickable.  The clickable link arises when a document is typed by hand, with auto-complete turned on, and then viewed by with HTML formatting.   Neither of these applications is treating the document as XML, rather they are treating it as HTML.   In particular, none of the applications know anything about XML or the <code>xmlns</code> attribute.  Thus the context of usage has incorrectly view the <code>xmlns</code> attribute as HTML.  When this happens, that is people are reading and writing sample XML documents using HTML formatting, the worst downside is that a person may waste 5-10 seconds.  </p><p>Contrasting with this is the approach of using a <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a>.  A <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> provides an
identifier.  A human looking at an xml document with a <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> namespace name will not be confused
about whether it is dereferencable or not.  No software will "auto-complete"
e.g. an <code>xri:...</code> identifier into a clickable link.  The 5-10 seconds of potentially wasted time 
are avoided.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="iddiv2137972536" id="iddiv2137972536"></a>4.6 Summary</h3><p>Namespace names are just one example of a context of use.  Any use of an identifier, or any datatype for that matter, in an XML document has the same issues.  A provider of a
identifier must specify how the identifier will be used in each specific sub-context of their XML language, whether it
is intended as an identifier, a location, or both.  Using a <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> instead of an <code>http:</code> URI does not make the software or human's job any easier.</p><p>This section has shown that http: uris have a large benefit over urns: when used as namespace names because the namespace name could 
			optionally be dereferencable, and the only downside is a fairly minimal amount of wasted

solution advised by <a href="#XRI">[XRI]</a> is to use identifiers that have bang ("!") symbols to indicate persistence.   An example is <code>xri://@!9990!AF8F!1C3D/!2495</code>.  We examine this scenarios in order.

Another common reason for a new identifier scheme is to come up with an
identifier that is location-independent or "movable" from one
location to another.  The idea is that the document changes location but the identifier should still resolve to the same document.  In all cases, there must be some kind of mapping of the identifier to the "new" location if a location is changed.

If <code>department.agency.example.org</code> ever disappeared, all the clients would break on that document.  With XRI identifiers, there is a dependency upon the <code>@</code> authority and related resolvers.  The "long-term" viability question then is whether XRI resolvers will "last" longer than HTTP Servers on given domain names.  </p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="iddiv3124841704" id="iddiv3124841704"></a>5.2.2 Configuration</h4><p>There are two steps to making the document available at the new URI.  Firstly, the Web server must be configured to do the 301 and new Location (the redirect).  In Apache 2.2, this is a configuration line such as <code> Redirect /service http://foo2.example.com/service</code>.  Secondly, the document must be made available at http://newdept.agency.example.org/documents/govdoc.pdf.</p><p>XRI allows a simpler retrieval once the authority is known by removing the redirect step.  The authority maps the identifier to the new document and retrieval of <code>ns/foo</code> is avoided.  The change process is simpler as well.  The new address is an XML entry instead of a registry must be updated and the new <code>ns/latest/foo</code> must be added to the system.</p><p>Now the question is about the relative difficulties in updating an HTTP Server or to update an XRI resolver.  In either case there will be some kind of submission and approval process.  There is widespread deployment of HTTP and HTTP Administrators, it seems likely that the configuration change (one line redirect in Apache) is probably roughly equivalent to updating XRI descriptor element at a URI.</p><p>In both solutions, the mappings from old identifiers to new identifiers are stored.  XRI calls this out as "However such an approach would eventually lead to a spaghetti code of new-to-old XRI mappings.  It also has the drawback of preventing reassignment of the identifier "department" for another purpose."</p></div></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="iddiv2124844360" id="iddiv2124844360"></a>5.3 Persistence Identifiers</h3><p>The persistence of an identifier has operational and expressive characteristics.</p><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="iddiv3139093760" id="iddiv3139093760"></a>5.3.1 Operational policy</h4><p>Let us return to the persistence of the identifiers without regards to derefencability.  The <code>xri:</code> scheme is managed by the XRI committee within OASIS.   
			OASIS has the authority to change the XRI scheme, probably at the request of the XRI committee.  It is possible for the XRI scheme to cease being maintained by the XRI committee, and even some other committee or organization take it over.  Should another organization choose to create an alternative XRI scheme, then there would probably be a dispute perhaps with a dispute resolution mechanism.   As the XRI specification says "As with URNs, the issue of whether a persistent sub-segment is in fact permanent (never reassigned)
			 is a matter of operational policy for the assigning authority. XRIs can't help with the operational issue ..."</p><p>An <code>http:</code>-based naming scheme for documents is managed by the organization that owns the domain in the URI.  
			The organization does not have to register new schemes anywhere.  In the case of <code>http://www.oasis-open.org</code> URIs, OASIS has the authority to assign and change the URIs or URI schemes on its own, without any review.   It is possible for the domain to cease being owned by OASIS, through lack of maintenance or even error.  Alternatively, the XRI community could use an <code>http:</code> based URI, such as <code>http://xri.net</code>.  Then the owner of the xri.net domain, presumably the XRI TC, would be responsible for managing the domain.  As with all names, the domain could lapse.  And as with <code>XRI</code> identifiers, there is the possibility of conflicts and disputes.</p><p>With all identifiers, the persistence of any particular identifier and scheme are up 
			to the registering organization and the registration authority.  <code>http:</code> and <code>XRI:</code> are equivalent in the operational policies determining persistence.</p></div><div class="div3">
<h4><a name="iddiv3139095840" id="iddiv3139095840"></a>5.3.2 Intent</h4><p>Both schemes can express the intent of persistence.   As the XRI specification says "XRIs can't help with the operational issue, but XRI syntax allows the 
			 authority to express its intent".   XRI uses the bang ("!") symbol to indicate that the identifier that follows is persistent.  XRI uses the star ("*") symbol to indicate that the identifier that follows is re-assignable. The XRI specification suggest that "a much better solution would be to assign the resource "govdoc.pdf" an identifier that never 
				needs to change or be reassigned ... such as <code>xri://@!9990!AF8F!1C3D/!2495</code>".  </p><p>It is possible for a URI authority to express its intent in the URIs it mints, so the same identification of persistence versus transience can be done using <code>http:</code> URIs.  The <code>http:</code> based XRI design will be shown shortly.</p><p>XRI and Web architecture effectively give the same guidance, that it is a much better solution to assign an identifier that never changes, as in <a href="#coolURIs">[Cool URIs]</a>.

<h3><a name="iddiv2139097224" id="iddiv2139097224"></a>5.4 Protocol Independence</h3><p>
			Protocol independence is a goal of XRI.  The previous HTTP redirects have shown that HTTP can do redirects, and it can do redirects to non http resources.  Starting from HTTP, a redirect to an <code>ftp:</code> resource is possible.  An important but subtle aspect of the web architecture is that the <code>http:</code> scheme for identifiers does not require the HTTP protocol to be used.  This is explored in <a href="#schemeProtocols">[Schemes and Protocols]</a>.</p></div><div class="div2">
<h3><a name="iddiv2139098016" id="iddiv2139098016"></a>5.5 XRI alternative design</h3><p>We suggest XRI should create URIs using the <code>http:</code> scheme, rather than inventing a non-URI based scheme.  The thread of documented good practices is that leads to this conclusion starts from <a href="#AWWW">[AWWW]</a>:</p><p class="prefix">Good Practice</p><p class="practice">To benefit from and increase the value of the World Wide Web, agents should provide URIs as identifiers for resources.</p><p class="prefix">Good Practice</p><p class="practice">A specification SHOULD reuse an existing URI scheme (rather than create a new one) when it provides the desired properties of identifiers and their relation to resources.</p><p>Intent is part of the potential 
			 metadata in URIs discussed in <a href="#metadatainuri">[Metadata in URI]</a>.  </p><p class="prefix">Good Practice</p><p class="practice">URI assignment authorities and the Web servers deployed for them may benefit from an orderly mapping from resource metadata into URIs</p><p>The XRI community could define constraints on <code>http:</code> uris containing a particular domain, such as xri.net.  
			The rules for persistence and location independence can be defined.  They could start with <code>http://xri.net</code> followed by roughly the current XRI rules and taking into account URI character constraints.  
				For example, the previous XRI persistent identifier could be similar to: <code>http://xri.net/@;9990;AF8F;1C3D/;2495</code>.  An alternative common practice for persistent identifiers is using UUIDs in the URI, ie:<code>http://example.org/6B29FC40-CA47-1067-B31D-00DD010662DA</code>.  Location independent identifiers can be achieved using HTTP redirects.
			There are many varieties of constraints upon any URIs and use of HTTP redirects.  One generalized framework for mapping XRIs or URNs to <code>http:</code> URIs 
			is at <a href="#urn2http">[urn2http]</a>.

<h3><a name="iddiv2128006416" id="iddiv2128006416"></a>5.6 Summary</h3><p>We have shown that <code>http:</code> identifiers for XRIs can achieve the goals of XRI with substation benefits.  The XRI goals of persistent identifiers and location independence are already available with <code>http:</code> identifiers.  There are two concrete benefits to using XRIs identified in the previous analysis: that users cannot waste time 
				by erroneously dereferencing namespace names that do not have namespace documents, and that an extra HTTP GET request is 
				avoided when documents move.   The XRI identifier solution's downsides are adding a new identifier scheme with the software and 
				human costs and seemingly mandatory increased network costs ( our example shows 2 HTTP GETs instead of 1).   
				Given these costs and benefits, deploying a new registrar, resolution mechanism and related software to layer on top of existing web 
				functionality is not justified.</p><p>Our analysis has shown that if the scheme definition for <code>xri:</code> says that it
<em>is</em> dereferencable, and specifies a mechanism, then either that
mechanism <em>is</em> HTTP, or it will have to provide all the
functionality, and thus be heir to all the weaknesses, <em>of</em> HTTP. 
In either case little benefit has been gained over just using the <code>http:</code>
scheme itself.  Note we have not yet compared the authority resolution mechanisms and the dependence upon centralized authority.  
We have also not compared the distributed authoring of identifiers either.</p><p> In the <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> identifier scenario, the "location" to be
used for knowledge is somewhere in the application or in some
property of the <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> such as a URI scheme or URN (sub)scheme.  The <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> proposals includes means to
transform a <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a> into
a dereferencable address via lookup using a registry server.  This in turn requires the use of a
dereferencable address for the server, or else all software intended
for use with <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRIs</a> must have the registry server locations
"hard-coded".  As far as we can tell, all the <a title="myRI" href="#nri">myRI</a>
proposals expect the results of server lookup to be an <code>http:</code> URI,
and also appear to use an <code>http:</code> URL to identify the location of the
registry server.</p></div></div><div class="div1">
<h2><a name="iddiv1141937128" id="iddiv1141937128"></a>6 Case study: new URI scheme with no protocol</h2><p>
A main advantage of <code>http:</code> URIs is the use of DNS to allow decentralized
creation of vocabularies.  This does bear the cost that humans can be
confused by the mixing of location and identifiers.  Another possibility
is to create and register a scheme that does not have any protocol associated with
it but follows all the rest of the <code>http:</code> syntax.  This is something like a cross between URNs and <code>http:</code> URIs.</p><div class="exampleOuter">
<div class="exampleHeader"><a name="idexample141937944" id="idexample141937944"></a>Example 10: id: scheme</div><div class="exampleInner"><pre>&lt;myns:foo xmlns:myns="id://docs.oasis-open.org/tc/spec/date"/&gt;</pre></div></div><p>The intent is clear from the instance of the URI, that HTTP is not to be used for dereferencing.  Various programs do not "auto-complete" into clickable links.  However, similar to URNs, this does not allow the possibility for the dereferencing the link to retrieve a document.  If a human wants to find out about the specific namespace, how do they find out?  Returning to context, a human must understand that the <code>myns</code> is an XML namespace and how XML namespaces are used.  The use of <code>id:</code> or <code>http:</code> or <code>urn:</code> or <code>xri:</code> has done nothing to shield them from this requirement.  </p><p>There are very few advantages and significant downside to this approach. 
For these reasons, David Orchard never proceeded down the registration path for <code>id:</code>.</p></div></div><div class="back"><div class="div1">
